{"name":"Ums.ccml","tagline":"Custom Category Media Library for Universal Media Server and PS3 Media Server","body":"This plugin aims to provide individuals with a way of categorizing their media by allowing each individual media file to have their own meta file for description.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThis release has been tested with Universal Media Server version 2.50.0. It may or may not \r\nwork in previous and future versions of Universal Media Server or PS3 Media Server. Builds \r\nfor specific versions are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPlace the JAR file into the 'plugins' directory where you have installed your media server.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Categorizing Media\r\nThe plugin will scan your specified shared folders of your media server for video, audio and image media types. For a supported media type, it will check if a meta file (.meta) exists for that file.\r\n\r\nFor example, the media file:\r\n```\r\n\t\\Videos\\Gaming\\Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi\r\n```\r\nwill search for:\r\n```\r\n\t\\Videos\\Gaming\\Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi.meta\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe meta file is parses simple keys and values (like an ini file) where the key is the category type and the value is the category.\r\n\r\nTo continue the above example, we want to classify this media file of having a genre 'Trailers' and released in the year 2008. We would have the following in our meta file:\r\n```\r\n\tGenre=Trailers\r\n\tYear=2008\r\n```\r\nNow when I browse my media server under CCML I can now venture to this media file by navigating through either one of the following menus:\r\n```\r\n\t[1] Original File Browsing Method\r\n\t[2] #- CCML -#\r\n\t\t\tVideo\r\n\t\t\t\tGenre\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTrailers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDiablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi\r\n\t[3] #- CCML -#\r\n\t\t\tVideo\r\n\t\t\t\tYear\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2008\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDiablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no defined limitation on how many categories you have, however, this has only been tested with a small batch of media files.\r\n\r\n### Master Categories\r\nMaster categories are supported by specifying a reserved keyword \"Master\" as a category. If any meta file defines a master category for a specific media type, this should add another level between a media type and category types. For example, the following meta file exists:\r\n```\r\n\tMyActionMovie.avi.meta]\r\n\tMaster=Movie\r\n\tGenre=Action\r\n\r\n\tMyActionTvShow.avi.meta]\r\n\tMaster=TV\r\n\tGenre=Action\r\n\r\n\tMyActionUnknown.avi.meta]\r\n\tGenre=Action\r\n```\r\nIf no master keyword was provided, the following would be the result of the categorization:\r\n```\r\n\tCCML\r\n \t Video\r\n \t   Genre\r\n  \t    Action\r\n  \t      MyActionMovie.avi\r\n  \t      MyActionTvShow.avi\r\n  \t      MyActionUnknown.avi\r\n```\r\nIf master keywords are provided in the meta files, the following would be generated:\r\n```\r\n\tCCML\r\n\t  Video\r\n \t   Movie\r\n \t     Genre\r\n    \t    Action\r\n     \t     MyActionMovie.avi\r\n   \t TV\r\n   \t   Genre\r\n  \t      Action\r\n   \t       MyActionTvShow.avi\r\n  \t  Uncategorized\r\n  \t    Genre\r\n   \t     Action\r\n   \t       MyActionUnknown.avi\r\n```\r\n## CCML Cache\r\nOnce the plugin is loaded, your shared folders will be parsed for meta information. Once parsed, the information will be cached. If you make modifications to your meta information such as adding new content or altering a meta file, you will have to wait until you restart your media server.\r\n\r\n## Alternative Meta Folder\r\nMeta files can also be placed into an alternative folder. Configurable from the interface, a user can provide a folder which meta files can be mapped to a media file.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the following media file exists:\r\n```\r\n        \\Videos\\Gaming\\Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi\r\n```\r\nand the following alternative meta folder is set:\r\n```\r\n        \\MetaFolder\\\r\n```\r\nthe following file in the alternative meta folder will map meta information for the media:\r\n```\r\n        \\MetaFolder\\Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi.meta\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n * http://www.jdknight.me/hosted/ccml/\r\n * https://github.com/jdknight/ums.ccml/\r\n * http://www.universalmediaserver.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
