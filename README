Custom Category Media Library (CCML)
Plugin for Universal Media Server and PS3 Media Server
======================================================

This plugin aims to provide individuals with a way of categorizing their media by allowing 
each individual media file to have their own meta file for description.


Requirements
============

This release has been tested with Universal Media Server version 2.50.0. It may or may not 
work in previous and future versions of Universal Media Server or PS3 Media Server. Builds 
for specific versions are available.


Installation
============

Place the JAR file into the 'plugins' directory where you have installed your media server.


Usage
=====

Categorizing Media
------------------
The plugin will scan your specified shared folders of your media server for video, audio and 
image media types. For a supported media type, it will check if a meta file (.meta) exists for 
that file.

For example, the media file:
	\Videos\Gaming\Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi
will search for:	
	\Videos\Gaming\Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi.meta

The meta file is parses simple keys and values (like an ini file) where the key is the 
category type and the value is the category.

To continue the above example, we want to classify this media file of having a genre 'Trailers' 
and released in the year 2008. We would have the following in our meta file:

	Genre=Trailers
	Year=2008

Now when I browse my media server under CCML I can now venture to this media file by navigating 
through either one of the following menus:
	[1] Original File Browsing Method
	[2] #- CCML -#
			Video
				Genre
					Trailers
						Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi
	[3] #- CCML -#
			Video
				Year
					2008
						Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi

There is no defined limitation on how many categories you have, however, this has only been 
tested with a small batch of media files.

Master Categories
-----------------
Master categories are supported by specifying a reserved keyword "Master" as a category. If 
any meta file defines a master category for a specific media type, this should add another 
level between a media type and category types. For example, the following meta file exists:

	MyActionMovie.avi.meta]
	Master=Movie
	Genre=Action

	MyActionTvShow.avi.meta]
	Master=TV
	Genre=Action

	MyActionUnknown.avi.meta]
	Genre=Action

If no master keyword was provided, the following would be the result of the categorization:
	CCML
 	 Video
 	   Genre
  	    Action
  	      MyActionMovie.avi
  	      MyActionTvShow.avi
  	      MyActionUnknown.avi

If master keywords are provided in the meta files, the following would be generated:
	CCML
	  Video
 	   Movie
 	     Genre
    	    Action
     	     MyActionMovie.avi
   	 TV
   	   Genre
  	      Action
   	       MyActionTvShow.avi
  	  Uncategorized
  	    Genre
   	     Action
   	       MyActionUnknown.avi

CCML Cache
----------
Once the plugin is loaded, your shared folders will be parsed for meta information. Once parsed, 
the information will be cached. If you make modifications to your meta information such as adding 
new content or altering a meta file, you will have to wait until you restart your media server.

Alternative Meta Folder
---------
Meta files can also be placed into an alternative folder. Configurable from the interface, a user 
can provide a folder which meta files can be mapped to a media file.

For example, if the following media file exists:
        \Videos\Gaming\Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi
and the following alternative meta folder is set:
        \MetaFolder\
the following file in the alternative meta folder will map meta information for the media:
        \MetaFolder\Diablo3-CinematicTrailer_US.avi.meta
